Until 23th 
1.	Have to learn how to implement 
a.	Learn practicality 
2.	Finish techniques + extracting features 

Techniques
1.	Bag of words 
2.	Paragraph vector 
3.	One-hot vectors 


Classifiers: 
1.	SVM 
2.	Naïve Bayes
3.	Logistic regression 
4.	Neural Networks 
a.	FFNN(possibly) 



We are expecting the best result from doc2vec and NN 


Extracting features. 
1.	Lowercase 
2.	Remove punctuation 
3.	Stopword vs non-stopword (optional) -> maybe exclude “no” or “not”
4.	Spelling correction (optional) (e.g. ID:758 1hr -> 1 hour) 
5.	Lemmantization vs stemming  (lemmanatization might works better)
6.	
Text semantics and similarity
